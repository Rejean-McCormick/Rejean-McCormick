# Réjean McCormick · socio-technical architect

I design and ship civic utilities: shared infrastructure that helps people learn, coordinate, and govern together.

Core projects:
- **kOA** – a modular civic ecosystem
- **Konnaxion** – knowledge and civic platform
- **Orgo** – nervous system for organisations
- **Movement & narrative** – political program and story engine around King Klown

## kOA: the ecosystem

**kOA** (Konnaxion + Orgo + narrative layer) is a public-good ecosystem that links:

- people  
- knowledge and methods  
- projects and institutions  

…across four main spaces:

- **KonnectED** – learning, micro-credentials, re-use of global best practice  
- **keenKonnect** – open R&D, builds, and deployments  
- **Ethikos / Smart Vote** – structured debate, consultations, and weighted readings of results  
- **Kreative** – culture, archives, and patronage  

A shared spine handles identity, domain-specific merit, ethics-aware weighting (Ekoh), and auditable decision flows (Smart Vote). The same mechanics power education, collaboration, governance, and culture.

## Konnaxion · knowledge & civic platform

**Konnaxion** is the software implementation of kOA’s “knowledge platform”:

- Connects learning, R&D, consultations, and cultural projects into one workspace  
- Links out to existing OER catalogs, maker libraries, and civic tools instead of duplicating them  
- Provides multiple “readings” of any consultation or decision (raw crowd, expertise-weighted, stakeholder-specific)  
- Publishes a limited, curated library of validated debates, blueprints, and learning sequences for fast reuse

## Orgo · nervous system for organisations

**Orgo** is a multi-tenant nervous system for organisations:

- Ingests signals (emails, forms, APIs, imports)  
- Normalises them into **Cases** and **Tasks** under a shared schema  
- Routes them using labels and roles, with clear ownership  
- Tracks execution, escalations, and periodic reviews  
- Feeds an **Insights** layer so leaders can see bottlenecks, risks, and recurring patterns  

Target domains: administrations, schools, hospitals, NGOs, co-ops, and complex ops teams that want one backbone instead of fragmented ticketing tools.

## Movement · program and deployments

The same architecture supports a concrete public program:

- Education that reuses global best practices instead of rebuilding each curriculum from scratch  
- Health and justice systems supported by structured information flows and transparent prioritisation  
- Public administration running on Orgo-style backbones to reduce friction and blind spots  
- Early discovery of “quiet” talent through contributions and portable credentials

## Narrative layer · King Klown & Surreal

Around the platforms, a narrative engine makes the ideas legible and engaging:

- Fiction cycles (e.g. *King Klown Kronicles*, *Konvergence*)  
- Podcast / audiobooks and music  
- Stage work, including in-development pieces like *Le Ninja Arc-en-ciel*  
- Visual and audio media that re-use the same systems-thinking patterns
