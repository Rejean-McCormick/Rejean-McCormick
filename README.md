# Réjean McCormick

Socio-technical architect exploring how AI, civic platforms, and collective intelligence can be woven into concrete systems: donation rails, learning infrastructures, and governance tools that are transparent, accountable, and actually usable.

I design and prototype “civic utilities” that turn knowledge into a public resource and translate agreement into action.

## Areas of Focus

- Collective intelligence & open coordination  
- Civic platforms and “civic utilities” (KOA, Konnaxion)  
- Zero-skim philanthropy and cooperative rails for giving  
- AI applied to complex, high-stakes systems (governance, finance, infrastructure)  
- Sustainable infrastructure (modular compute, clean energy, local stewardship)

## Books

### Konvergence cycle

Fiction that doubles as systems thinking.

- **Konvergence: Échoïsme**  
  (English edition – Amazon)  
  `https://www.amazon.ca/Konvergence-%C3%89cho%C3%AFsme-R%C3%A9jean-McCormick-ebook/dp/B0F1CBRP1L`  

- **Konvergence: version franco**  
  (French edition – Amazon)  
  `https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/R%C3%A9jean-McCormick-ebook/dp/B0F1DNQSTD`  

At the core of the story is a character who shares my name: a man marked by loss and an obsession with the infinite structure of π. His search for meaning pulls him into emerging architectures of collective intelligence and alternative civic systems. The books are written as narrative but seeded with design patterns for governance, coordination, and ethical action. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### King Klown Kronicles

- **King Klown Kronicles: The Hidden Manifesto**  
  (Amazon – multiple regions)  
  Example Kindle link:  
  `https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/R%C3%A9jean-McCormick-ebook/dp/B0DZ76L1N3`  

In a city collapsing under neglect and indifference, one father’s unbearable loss becomes the spark for an improbable transformation. A broken system claims his son’s life, forcing him to face the apathy, decay, and quiet violence built into our institutions. The book is both a story and a manifesto—an exploration of what we tolerate, what we normalize, and how we might design something better. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### The Book of kOA

- **The Book of kOA: A Modular Civic Platform for Collective Intelligence and Ethical Action**  
  (PhilArchive entry, with citation details)  
  `https://philarchive.org/rec/MCCTBO-17`  

The Book of kOA lays out a manifesto and a systems design for a global, merit-based civic platform—**Konnaxion**—that turns knowledge into a public utility and translates agreement into action. It proposes a modular architecture built around four interoperable components: KonnectED (open education), keenKonnect (collaborative development), Ethikos (merit-weighted deliberation and voting), and Kreative (cultural commons), tied together by a merit and legitimacy backbone called EkoH. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

The design is grounded in principles such as:

- Radical lucidity  
- Transparency in governance / privacy of person  
- Inclusive social mobility  
- Ecological responsibility  
- Cooperation before competition  

It sketches how these ideas can be piloted in education, justice and rehabilitation, “Kristal Farms” open-knowledge infrastructures, and hybrid governance experiments.

## Academic & Policy Work

Some of my work appears on PhilArchive and PhilPapers, often at the intersection of social philosophy, applied ethics, and institutional design. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Key piece:

- **Zero-Skim Philanthropy Blueprint**  
  PhilArchive:  
  `https://philarchive.org/rec/MCCZPB`  

This policy brief argues that Canada’s giving system leaks value through platform skims, duplicated back-office costs, and leadership wage capture. It proposes a **utility-grade cooperative banking donation rail** operated by a credit union and its affiliated foundation, with:

- 0% platform take-rate  
- Thematic pooled funds  
- Member allocation via approval voting with a quorum  
- A ≤10% administrative-cost covenant at the grant level  
- Strict governance constraints (pay caps, conflict-of-interest rules, secrecy of the ballot, public dashboards) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

The goal: more net-to-program dollars, stronger democratic legitimacy, and a replicable model that other cooperative banks can adapt.

## Civic & Technical Projects

### Konnaxion (code)

Konnaxion is my primary socio-technical project on GitHub: a prototype civic platform intended to connect humans, structure collective action, and support cooperative models such as zero-skim donation rails.

- **Konnaxion repository**  
  `https://github.com/Rejean-McCormick/Konnaxion`  

The GitHub implementation is a work in progress that explores:

- Service architectures that reflect the kOA modular design  
- Data and identity layers that respect privacy while supporting transparency in governance  
- Interfaces for participation, deliberation, and merit tracking  

Over time, this space will include additional experiments: AI-assisted coordination tools, simulations, and small utilities aligned with the same design principles.

## This GitHub Space

This `Rejean-McCormick` repository is my **public landing page** on GitHub.

Here you can expect:

- Links to books, papers, and manifestos  
- Pointers to live code (like Konnaxion) implementing parts of those designs  
- Notes, drafts, and experiments that sit between theory and deployment  

If you’re coming from one of the books or papers and want to see where ideas become code, start with the **Konnaxion** repo and related projects listed here.

If you work on adjacent problems—civic tech, cooperative finance, AI for institutional design—and want to explore alignment or collaboration, the best entry points are the kOA/Konnaxion architecture, the Zero-Skim Blueprint, and the Book of kOA.
